now I'm currently learning mobile application development at and now I'm studying Kotlin to develop applications for android 

![Kotlin](https://res.cloudinary.com/crunchbase-production/image/upload/c_lpad,h_256,w_256,f_auto,q_auto:eco,dpr_1/lkhjmjah3o0ysebkckbz) 

And if you don't know what Kotlin is, it's a programming language that makes developers happier **(as they say! 👀)** but it's mostly known as android applications development language. 

And if you are interested in learning, please go to their website and learn more about it [link to Kotlin!](https://kotlinlang.org/) 

and if you ask why Kotlin there, it's because 

1. Full interoperability with Java 
2. Compatibility with all Android versions 
3. use JVM
4. and makes your life easier 😁 

and there are more uses for Kotlin but here I will focus and android development 

> and I also like coffee ☕
